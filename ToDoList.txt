Part1: Initialization
  Implement First Come First Serve
  Implement Shortest Remaining Time First
  Implement Round Robin with quantum value
  Implement Event1 process_event1 Process Arival
  Implement Event2 process_event2 Process Completion
  Implment Event3 process_event3 Time-Slice Occurance
  
  Fill event queue with more than 10,000 process 
    -Each process has a arrival time based on lamda
   
Part2: Run simulation
  Have a certain amount of processes enter within given time range
Part3: Generate Report
  Create plot with 4 metrics for each alogrithm
